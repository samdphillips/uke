# uke

This is a dataframe implementation for Racket that I've been playing with off
and on for a couple of years.

Goals:
- immutable indexes, series, and dataframes
- minimize copying of storage for series

(`uke` doesn't stand for anything.  I saw a Ukelele in my office when I was
naming  the project directory.)
